- **Understanding the Code:**
- The basic structure of a Flutter app (widgets, Dart, etc.) demands an understanding of well defined key files (e.g., `main.dart`, `pubspec.yaml`), please refer to the relevant section "Write your first Flutter app" in Flutter.dev docs (<https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab>)
- - **Customization:**
  - Your First Flutter app would possibly require customization, instructions on how to modify it can be found at  <https://docs.flutter.dev/ui> and  <https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/design/themes> from where you can experiment with different functionalities.
  
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Troubleshooting is a necessary step you have to cover as developer in order to deal with potential issues and their solutions (e.g., error messages, running the app on different devices), refer to relevant information at <https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/common-errors> and <https://docs.flutter.dev/testing/errors>.
  - The original main.dart file used in this project was adapted from <https://idx.google.com/namercodelabadvanced-2493126> which uses the Google IDX Editor, having this being adequated to the VS Code Editor after performing a number of customizations to eliminate errors in dependencies, upgrading and downloading packages, applying dart fixes, verifying outdated flutter pubs, upgrading flutter pubs, applying flutter doctor and running the app.
